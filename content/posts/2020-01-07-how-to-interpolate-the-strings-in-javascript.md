this post we will learn how to interpolation string in javascript with es6 template literals

## **String interpolation Example**

To interpolate the string in es6, we need to use the backticks followed by a `${}` syntax.

```jsx
let fruit = "durion";
console.log(`My favourite fruit is ${user}`); // My favourite fruit is durion
```

## **Multi-line strings Example**

for multi-line strings you can do like this.

```jsx
console.log(
  `Replacing placeholders with values inside of a string literal is named string interpolation.`
);
```
