React Native is one of the most popular mobile application frameworks, and not without reason. Ease of use, modular nature, and a unique code base are a blessing for mobile application developers.

Food Delivery is a component-based application model for React Native. The source code is written in JavaScript and the final application can be created for the Android and iOS platforms.
