React Native is a JavaScript framework that can be used to create truly native applications for platforms like iOS and Android. It is based on a JavaScript library created by Facebook called React and thus brings its performance to the native development of mobile applications.

It corresponds with today’s mobile app development market needs, as with two operating systems dominating the landscape, enterprises creating mobile apps often face a decision: build apps that give a better user experience or apps that are faster to develop and run on more platforms and devices?

The concept of creating apps using only one paradigm for all platforms sounds a bit unbelievable. However, React Native, despite its immaturity, allows accelerating the process of building apps across different platforms, thanks to the likelihood of reusing most of the code between them.

For the convenience of my readers, I have compiled a list of the 5 React Native listing app that helps your build Yelp clone.
